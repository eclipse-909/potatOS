2024 Browser-based Operating System in TypeScript
=================================================

This is Alan's Operating Systems class initial project.
See https://www.labouseur.com/courses/os/ for details.
It was originally developed by Alan and then enhanced by Bob Nisco and Rebecca Murphy over the years.

# Assembler/Text Editor
I made this 6502 assembler/text-editor for Org and Arch in Spring 2024.
It should work for this project since Operating Systems uses a subset of
the ISA that Org and Arch uses. Feel free to use it and share it.
