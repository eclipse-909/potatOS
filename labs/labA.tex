\section{Problem One}
Q) How well does your operating system work?\\
A) For most use cases it works quite well. I'm pretty happy with how it's come along. There are a few bugs and parts of the code that I wanted to fix or do differently. There are some edge cases where it gets a little wonky, like if there is text at the bottom of the console, and more text is output, it might write on top of the existing text if it tries to start a new line. This can be fixed just by scrolling, so I'm not prioritizing fixing it. I'm also not very happy with the architecture for the execution pipeline. I made the shell before the CPU and disk, so I wasn't taking into consideration how I wanted the execution pipeline to work. It's weird because I have programs that run on the CPU and others that run in the browser (shell commands). They don't really work well together. I kind of just stitched the shell, CPU, and file system together and hoped for the best. Those are the main issues I've had, but everything else seems to be working as expected.
